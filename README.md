## Brief Description
This game is a recreation of the well-known Tetris game. The aim is to clear the row and accumulate as much points as possible.

##Instructions
Press the up key to rotate. The other arrow keys are for movement. The rest of the rules are pretty similar to the original game. There are four speeds, although the "You are scary" speed is basically unplayable.

## Inspiration
I have been playing "Tricky Towers" as of late with my brother, and I was inspired to build my first JavaScript game based on a similar game. Overall, I thought it was challenging enough for me to clear the lines and detect the blocks. 

##Other additional comments:
* There are still some slight bugs in the program for block detection, but for the most part it works well.
* Looking back I wish I took more of an OOP approach or used Canvas API because it took a lot longer to code than I thought it would.
* Overall, pretty happy with the result after eight hours. Challenged me a lot in terms of using arrays and creating the game board from divs.
